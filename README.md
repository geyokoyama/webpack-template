# Webpack Template

This repo was initially for learning how to start projects using webpack, which
I've only utilized through the [create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/)
without knowing how to configure it. Once I have, I decided to keep the repo to be
used as a template for future projects.

## Usage

Once cloned, you'll want to make changes to the following file(s) to personalize
your project.

* README.md         - This very file. You'll want your own README for your project.
* package.json      - Change the name, author, and description for starters.
* webpack.common.js - Under build-utils/. Change the _title_ under
  _HtmlWebpackPlugin_ to your liking.

Then get coding!

## Todo

* Add images
* create js/css folders to avoid clutter in src
